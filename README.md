# StepperEncoder


Stepper motor controller using the Adafruit Motor Shield Library and the AccelStepper library. The Motor Shield library is wrapped with an AccelStepper object in order to allow for automatic acceleration/deceleration and absolute position control. The code is quite short, but has the potential to be expanded to allow for stall detection and prevention, as well as countless other functions.
